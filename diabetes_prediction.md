## This is a supervised learning to predict diabetes using clinical features.


Diabetes is a prevalent and serious health condition characterized by high blood sugar levels
resulting from insufficient insulin production or ineffective insulin utilization in the body. Accurately
predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes is crucial for healthcare professionals to
identify high-risk individuals and implement timely interventions and preventive strategies. In this
project, we aim to address a classification problem using supervised learning techniques. The
objective is to leverage a combination of medical and demographic data to develop a predictive
model to predict the likelihood of developing diabetes.
